# ChromeNewTab

ChromeNewTab (or ngNewTab) is a starter page for a new tab built as a Chrome extension. 

Feel free to fork the project. I won't accept any Pull Requests until I can get a style guide and 
planning wiki up. I'm not actually expecting anyone to even see this anyway, never mind make a PR. 
So if you want to and I'm taking too long, just shout. 

## Usage

This project currently utilises Firebase (and [AngularFire2](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2)) for it's server (Planning on building my own one day). 
In order to make full use of the app, set up a project on your firebase console, and add the config 
variable to your environments files (as stated [here](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2/blob/master/docs/install-and-setup.md)).

Once Firebase is configured, test it on your local development server with `ng serve`. 

Once you're happy, run the Build with `ng build`. In the `app` folder, you'll find a `manifest.json`
file. Edit as you wish and then copy that file into your built project inside your `dist` folder.

To install, open up `chrome://extensions` in your (Chrome obviously) browser. At the top of the page 
you'll find a toggle switch called 'developer mode'. 
Toggle that switch and use the new `load unpacked` button to upload the project files. 

Open a new tab and off you go!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
